index.html <br>
The HTML file contains the basic structure for the webpage, including the 'html', 'head', and 'body' tags. <br>
In the 'head' section, there are meta tags for character encoding and viewport settings, and the title of the webpage is set to "Shoe Page". <br>
The local stylesheet (styles.css) is linked to the HTML document. <br>
The content of the webpage is wrapped in a 'main' element. <br>
Inside the main element, there are two 'section' elements, one for the textual content and another for an image. <br>
The textual content section includes an 'h1' element for the shoe's name and two 'p' elements for the description. <br>
The image section includes an 'img' element with the class main-image, displaying the shoe image. <br>

styles.css
The CSS file defines styles for various elements used in the HTML. <br>
The body is styled with a light gray background color. <br>
The section element is styled with a maximum width and is displayed as an inline-block. <br>
The first child section is further styled with a margin to create space between the two sections and white text color. <br>
The .main-image class styles the shoe image, setting its maximum width, position, and transition on hover. <br>
The main element is styled with a linear gradient background and a box shadow to create a card-like appearance. <br>
The positioning, padding, margin, width, and height properties further style the main element. <br>
The body::before pseudo-element is used to create a skewed background gradient that overlays the main content. <br>
Styles for headings ('h1') and paragraphs ('p') include font sizes and margin adjustments. <br>
